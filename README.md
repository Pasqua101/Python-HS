# Python-HS
Python files from when I learned python in my grade 10 and 11 computer science classes.
Includes topics from arrays, variables, loops, strings, and a final assignment that I made in grade 10 where I made a text based rpg. Unfortuntaley the audio files for the final are too big to fit on github and the code needs to be updated to python 3.0. The music files can be found here https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlZQQzsLvWSoisJxs1fDiyxWWK9RUQ?e=1iEQ9X
